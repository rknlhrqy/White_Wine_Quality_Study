Here is the change to wine.Rmd, based on the review from Udacity.

1, Add the following code to disable codes, warnings and messages.

```{r global_options, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, messages=FALSE)
```

2, Change geom_histogram() to geom_bar() when drawing the distribution of Quality, because Quality is a categorical varaible.

3, Add comments into function remove_outliers() and in some other codes.

4, Separate the lines of code which is longer than 80 characters.

5, In all histogram plots, adjust the bin size, to get the more appropriate and clear plots and remove the empty spaces between bins.

6, The ggpairs plot is over-crowded and axis labels cannot be seen. They are split up into several different plots.

7, Quality is discrete and ordinal. Boxplot should be used instead of Scatter plots. So all scatter plots for Quality and one other feature is replaced with Boxplots.

8, In Multivariate section, the facet plots are redrawn using position_dodge and Legend's name is filled correctly.

9, In Bivariate section, more analysis is added to the statistics.

10, Plot 1 is changed. A bar plot of Quality and its normal distribution curve is added.

11, Plot 2: the legend title is added.

12, Plot 3, Quality is a discrete variable and the boxplot is added.
